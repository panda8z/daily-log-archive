## 1. 英文原版 ：Welcome to a tour of Go

#### Using the tour

Welcome to a tour of the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/). The tour covers the most important features of the language, mainly:

[Welcome!](http://127.0.0.1:3999/welcome)

Learn how to use this tour: including how to navigate the different lessons and how to run code.

#### Basics

The starting point, learn all the basics of the language.

Declaring variables, calling functions, and all the things you need to know before moving to the next lessons.

[Packages, variables, and functions.](http://127.0.0.1:3999/basics)

Learn the basic components of any Go program.

[Flow control statements: for, if, else, switch and defer](http://127.0.0.1:3999/flowcontrol)

Learn how to control the flow of your code with conditionals, loops, switches and defers.

[More types: structs, slices, and maps.](http://127.0.0.1:3999/moretypes)

Learn how to define types based on existing ones: this lesson covers structs, arrays, slices, and maps.

Methods and interfaces

Learn how to define methods on types, how to declare interfaces, and how to put everything together.

[Methods and interfaces](http://127.0.0.1:3999/methods)

This lesson covers methods and interfaces, the constructs that define objects and their behavior.

#### Concurrency

Go provides concurrency features as part of the core language.

This module goes over goroutines and channels, and how they are used to implement different concurrency patterns.

[Concurrency](http://127.0.0.1:3999/concurrency)

Go provides concurrency constructions as part of the core language. This lesson presents them and gives some examples on how they can be used.
